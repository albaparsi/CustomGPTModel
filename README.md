This project aims to build and train a GPT-like language model using PyTorch. The model is designed to generate text based on a given input prompt. The implementation includes the following:

Data preprocessing and tokenization
Transformer-based architecture with multi-head self-attention
Text generation capabilities
Features

Transformer-based language model with multi-head self-attention
Custom data handling using memory-mapped files for efficient training on large datasets
Ability to generate coherent text based on input prompts
Configurable hyperparameters (embedding size, number of layers, heads, etc.)
Model Architecture

The model is built using a multi-layer transformer architecture with the following components:

Embedding layer for token and positional embeddings
Multi-head self-attention mechanism
Feed-forward network
Layer normalization and dropout
Linear projection for vocabulary prediction
